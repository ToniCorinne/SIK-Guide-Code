/***************************************************************
 *  The buzzer in your Inventor's Kit is an electromechanical
 * component you can use to make noise. Inside the buzzer is a
 * coil of wire and a small magnet. When current flows through 
 * the coil, it becomes magnetized and pulls towards the magnet,
 * creating a tiny "click". When you do this thousands of times
 * per second, you create tones.
 * 
 * The Arduino has a built-in command called tone() which clicks
 * the buzzer at a certain frequency. This sketch knows the
 * frequencies of the common notes, allowing you to create songs.
 * We're never going to let you down!
 * 
 * Hardware connections:
 * 
 * The buzzer has two pins. One is positive and one is negative.
 * The postitive pin is marked by a "+" symbol on both the top
 * and bottom of the buzzer.
 * 
 * Connect the positive pin to Arduino digital pin 9.
 * (Note that this must be a PWM pin.)
 * Connect the negative pin to GND.
 * 
 * Tip: if the buzzer doesn't fit into the breadboard easily,
 * try rotating it slightly to fit into diagonal holes.
